## Original Assignment  
Define a Book class containing the values author, title, and page count, and methods to retrieve and modify the data.  

## Solution  
I created a command line interface to interact with the Book class using my previous work as a guide. The CLI works by running an input-loop, and checking the given input against a list of available commands. Since the commands are saved in list form, the user may also enter a number (the index of the desired command) and the program will input the proper command for you.
